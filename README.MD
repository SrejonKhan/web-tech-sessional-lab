# Web Technologies Sessional

I wrote this project in one sitting on January 2, 2025. It was a wonderful morning. The fog hung in the air, creating a peaceful and beautiful atmosphere outside. I felt a burst of happiness that helped me finish the project all at once. I will always remember that morning, which is why I wanted to share it here.

The project is built using the following stack:

- **PHP**: For server-side scripting and handling backend logic.
- **MySQL**: As the database to store user information and posts.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and pre-built UI components.
- **Basic Vanilla JavaScript**: For client-side scripting and enhancing user interactions.

The project includes features such as user authentication (sign up, sign in, sign out), profile management, and the ability to create, view, and delete posts.

How to run the project:

- Clone this repository to your local machine. `git clone https://github.com/SrejonKhan/web-tech-sessional-lab`
- Install XAMPP or any other local server environment.
- Start the Apache and MySQL servers.
- Make sure to copy the project files to the `htdocs` folder in XAMPP.
  - For XAMPP, the path is usually `C:\xampp\htdocs`. Or, in case of Linux, `/opt/lampp/htdocs`.
  - Perhaps, the name of the folder could be `web-tech-sessional-lab`.
- Create a folder named `/upload` inside `web-tech-sessional-lab`. This is where the uploaded images will be stored.
- Import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL database.
- Update the database connection details in `config.php`, if requires.
- Visit `http://localhost/web-tech-sessional-lab` in your browser.

That's it! You should now see the project up and running.
